# Factorio Boring Drill
 The factory must grow (downwards!)

 Adds a boring drill that allows you to dig infinitely lower (new underground surfaces) at an ever increasing cost. 
 Very WIP
 
     Current Features:
     Tweaks burner drills/ electric drills to require drill bits.
     Unlock the boring drill by researching land fill.
     The boring drill requires some parts (drill bits, cable and concrete) to drill.
      (And outputs basic resources!)
     After an amount of drills (based on the toughness/depth of the current level), the drill will breach the current layer and transform into an item elevator.
     The item elevator:
          Has a matching one on the lower surface
          Can be used to transfer the player to that surface
          +Electricity
          +Items (ofc)
          
Also, sulfur production is moved until after Chemical Science. On vanilla this should mean you need sulfur to get sulfur. I wonder where you might find some...
     
Planned? Features:

    Increased ore when going down levels
    Lava/magma/geothermal power
    Heat chemical plants
    
    
    Special levels??
         Biter hell? + has diamonds though
         Magma Swamps
         Tropical island paradise???
         
    More balance features
         Elevator maintanence
         More drill bit types (diamond drills?)
         Alternate recipes using underground resources
         
     A final level?
     Collect samples from the core of Nauvis and send them to space to win the game?
